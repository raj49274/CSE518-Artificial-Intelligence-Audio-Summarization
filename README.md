## Algorithm
- Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency (Tf-idf) Summarizer
- Frequency based Summarizer
- Gensim based summarizer
- Gensim with LDA and Mallet's allocation
- Speech to text converser


## Introduction
One of the primary applications of natural language processing is to automatically extract what topics people are discussing from large volumes of text. Some examples of large text could be feeds from Books, Youtube videos, movies, etc, user feedbacks, news stories, e-mails of customer complaints etc

Knowing what people are talking about and understanding their problems and opinions is highly valuable to businesses, administrators, political campaigns. And itâ€™s really hard to manually read through such large volumes and compile the topics


## Approach


## Libraries
- Youtube-dl
- webvtt-py
- scikit learn
- tkinter
- numpy
- TfidfVectorizer and CountVectorizer
- Pandas
- Gensim 
- pyLDAvis
- matpllotlib
